      <h1>1.1 Getting Started - About Version Control</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin
          by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on
          to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it
          set up to start working with. At the end of this chapter you should
          understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should
          be all set up to do so.

      <h2>About Version Control</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control
          is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time
          so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in
          this book, you will use software source code as the files being
          version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly
          any type of file on a computer.

          If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version
          of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a
          Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows
          you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the
          entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time,
          see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who
          introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally
          means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily
          recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

        <h3>Local Version Control Systems</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files
            into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if
            they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so
            simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to
            forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the
            wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs
            that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files
            under revision control.

          <p>
            One of the more popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which
            is still distributed with many computers today. RCS works by
            keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a
            special format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked
            like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.

        <h3>Centralized Version Control Systems</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to
            collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this
            problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were
            developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce)
            have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a
            number of clients that check out files from that central place.
            For many years, this has been the standard for version control.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="imageblock">
          <div class="content">
            <img src="./assets/img/centralized.png" alt="Centralized version control diagram" />
          </div>
          <div class="title">Figure 2. Centralized version control.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For
            example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on
            the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control
            over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS
            than it is to deal with local databases on every client.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            However, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most
            obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server
            represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that
            hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to
            anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database
            is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you
            lose absolutely everything&thinsp;—&thinsp;the entire history of
            the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have
            on their local machines. Local VCS systems suffer from this same
            problem&thinsp;—&thinsp;whenever you have the entire history of
            the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.
          </p>

        <h3>Distributed Version Control Systems</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in.
            In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t
            just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they
            fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if
            any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that
            server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to
            the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of
            all the data.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="imageblock">
          <div class="content">

          </div>
          <div class="title">Figure 3. Distributed version control.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having
            several remote repositories they can work with, so you can
            collaborate with different groups of people in different ways
            simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up
            several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized
            systems, such as hierarchical models.
